 ## Introduction  
  #### Neurons communicate with each other in a precisely timed manner within a complex neural network. To transfer information in real-time dialogues between neurons, they release neurotransmitters and also receive them in synapses, which is represented as synaptic transmission. In order to decode information in this neuronal synaptic connection, it is essential to detect, measure, and analyze characteristics of synaptic transmission between neurons. Of various elements of synaptic transmission, the postsynaptic current (PSC) has been extensively analyzed to understand neuronal synapse property in electrophysiology.1–3. In terms of neurophysiology, PSCs are generated spontaneously or evoked by following presynaptic spikes, which is represented as miniature or spontaneous responses in postsynaptic neurons respectively. These miniature and spontaneous responses can be used for quantum analysis in synaptic transmission. Therefore, quantitative analysis of synaptic events of PSCs in neurons is a fundamental step to characterize synaptic properties in the brain.       
 #### While the results of quantitative analysis of PSCs are informative, a workflow for this analysis is time-consuming and laborious. To simplify the workflow and make it more efficient, several automated methods have been applied in the detection of spontaneous PSCs4–9. However, even after the completion in reliable detection of PSCs, it still remains redundant following steps dragging researchers to keep doing consecutive and iterative analysis to interpret the results. These steps include averaging and visualizing the data grouped by a custom manner, and also performing statistical assessments that neurophysiologists uses typically. Although there have been several attempts to improve the efficiency of the event detection process for electrophysiologists, however, there is still a lack of solutions to efficiently manage the analyzed data thereafter10. An integrated solution would improve the convenience and efficiency of researcher’s activity by simplifying the workflow from detection to interpretation of PSC data.         
 #### Here, we present an integrated software package for detection and measurement of spontaneous synaptic events. This package, Minhee Analysis Package, is built to detect spontaneous PSCs, search and visualize them in a custom way, and perform the hypothesis testing of the retrieved data. This package utilizes a stepwise and exploratory search algorithm to detect PSCs. To create up-to-date tables of data, users can search their data in one’s defined manner. After the successful retrieval of the data, the package automatically generates general and cumulative histograms to represent the distribution of data. The package serves two hypothesis testing methods, student’s t-test for comparing averaged values between two groups and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for comparing distribution of data between two groups. All of Minhee Analysis Package’s functionality is accessible via its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). Minhee Analysis Package can be downloaded at http://www.github.com/parkgilbong/Minhee_Analysis_Pack.
 
 ## Material and Methods
 ### Package development environment 
 #### Mihee analysis package was developed in LabVIEW (version 2017, National instrument, USA), which includes a large library of functions for signal process and analysis. Labview development environment provides a GUI that provides native controls and utilities for all features of the package. In addition, the development environment provides the application builder that enables the package to be distributed as a stand-alone application with a binary installer. 
 ### Algorithms for event detection
 ####  To search for PSC events, Minhee analysis package utilizes a step-by-step search algorithm using user-defined and built-in functions in LabVIEW. The detection procedure has four steps, smoothing, initial search, baseline search, and final search (Figure 1). In the first step, Savitzky-Golay (S-G) Filter VI is used  for the purpose of smoothing the data (Figure 1B). S-G filter method performs a local polynomial regression around each point, and creates a new, smoothed value for each data point. S-G filter requires two parameters, which are adjustable parameters to achieve successful event detection in Minhee analysis package. Polynomial order specifies the order of the polynomial. Side points determine the number of data points to each side of the current data point to use the for the least squares minimization. The second step, initial search, employs a built-in function of the advanced signal processing toolkit called Multiscale Peak Detection VI in LabVIEW (Figure 1C). Peaks in the signal whose amplitude exceeds 3 pA are accepted as local peaks (or valleys). Once the location of the local peak define, the algorithm begins a backward search for the baseline of the local event at the local peak (Figure 1D). In the baseline search step, the algorithm uses 2nd derivative of the trace to find local minimum (or maximum). In the final step, the algorithm calculates the amplitude of event as the peak amplitude minus the baseline (Figure 1E). If the amplitude of the event exceeds an user-defined criterion (minimal amplitude in event detection parameters), the event is accepted. Otherwise, the events are discarded.
### Simulation of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs)
#### Simulated EPSCs were randomly generated by the quantal conductance represented as a multiexponential function (Equation (1)) with a peak amplitude of  -12.78309 nS, τ1 = 0.5 ms, and τ2 = 3 ms, which were typical values of a EPSC in a hippocampal neuron at room temperature. To generate variation in PSC events, a random number drawn from a normal distribution with mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0.3 was multiplied with time constants, τ1 and τ2. A total of 250 simulated PSCs were generated and positioned randomly in a 250-sec long idealized waveform (Figure 3A and B). To test effects of the background noise on event detection performance for the package, three types of  background noise with standard deviation of 2, 6, and 10 pA were added to the idealized waveform with simulated events, respectively (Figure 3C). Referring to the position of simulated PSCs in the idealized waveform, we computed a confusion matrix containing the number of true positive, true negative, and false positive, and  false negative to summarize the detection performance of the package under the effects of  three background noises, respectively. Based on the confusion matrix, the true positive rate (TPR = true positive/(true positive + false negative)) and the false positive rate (FPR = false positive/(false positive + true negative)) were derived. All procedures of simulation were performed using R (v3.6., https://www.r-project.org). 
### Recording of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in vitro 
#### For whole-cell patch-clamp recording of spontaneous PSCs, 7 week-old male C57BL/6 mouse was used. Animal were decapitated and coronal slices were cut using a vibratome (VT 1200, Leica). Slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 30-32℃ controlled by a peristaltic pump. Cells in prelimbic region were visualized with 40x magnification objective (Olympus) on the stage of upright microscope (BX61W1, Olympus) equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast optics in combination with digital camera (AquaCAM Pro/S3). Patch microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (O.D.:1.5mm, I.D.: 1.10mm, WPI) on a Flaming-Brown micropipette puller model P-1000 (Sutter Instruments, USA). Patch microelectrodes had a resistance of 4-8MΩ. Signals were recorded using a patch-clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Axon Instruments, USA) and digitized with Digidata 1550A (Axon Instruments, USA) using Clampex software. Signals were amplified, sampled at 10 kHz, and filtered to 2 or 5 kHz. Pyramidal neurons were identified by large apical dendrites. During voltage-clamp recordings, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) was recorded at -60mV membrane holding potential with high chloride intracellular solution (in mM): 150 CsCl, 2 MgCl26H2O, 0.1 CaCl22H2O 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 Na-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP respectively. During sIPSC recording, 10 µM NBQX and 50 µM AP-5 (Tocris) were bath applied to block excitatory synaptic responses.  Recorded sIPSC was analyzed using two programs employing different detection algorithms, Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, USA) and Clampfit (Molecular Devices, USA), respectively, as well as Minhee analysis package. As for Mini Analysis, the amplitude and area thresholds were set to 10 and 6.9462, respectively. In regard with Clampfit, event template was created according to the user manual. Template match threshold was adjusted to 6.
